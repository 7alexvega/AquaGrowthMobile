# AquaGrowth Mobile

AquaGrowth Mobile is an iOS app that helps gardeners monitor their plants health.

## About
AquaGrowth Mobile works by utilizing hardware and software components. Regarding hardware, Aquagrowth uses an arduino with sensors to monitor your plants health (sunlight, soil moisture, temperature and humidity). Our app connects to this device via bluetooth. Within the app you can see your plants current and long term health. To do so you must first create a plant profile. An inital pairring is required for the AquaGrowth device. Afterwards you can read data for any given plant by inserting the device inside the plants soil.
